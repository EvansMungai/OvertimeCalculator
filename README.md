# Overtime Calculator Project

**About this project**

This is a JAVA project to calculate the overtime worked by an employee of a company. 

## Problem Statement

You are required to write a program to calculate the overtime worked by an employee of a company. To do this, consider each week day with 8 regular hours. If an employee works more than 8 hours in one day, any time over that is considered overtime. In this payroll simulation, we will cover two weeks but each week has its own separate calculation. After collecting the time for both weeks and performing the calculation, display the number of regular hours, the number of hours worked overtime, the amount pay for the regular hours, and the amount pay for overtime, if any. At the end,  display the total net pay.
Use the inputs in the screenshot below and you should get similar results.
